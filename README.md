# Dotdiff

Dotdiff is a very basic wrapper around [perceptual-diff](http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/) which works with both Capybara and RSpec to capture and compare the images with a simple rspec matcher.

It is now also possible to snapshot a particular element on the page just by using the standard capybara finders - which once the element is found will query the browser for its dimensions and placement on the page and use that metadata to crop using chunky_png from a full page snapshot.

It can also hide certain elements via executing javascript for elements which can change with different display suchas username or user specific details, but only for full page screenshots.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'dotdiff'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dotdiff


## Usage

### Dependencies
First ensure to install perceptualdiff binary which is available via apt-get and brew or via http://pdiff.sourceforge.net/

In your spec/spec_helper
```
require 'dotdiff'
```

If you want the rspec_matcher require the following as well
```
require 'dotdiff/rspec_matcher'
```

### Configuration
In an initializer you can configure certain options example shown below within Dotdiff

```ruby
DotDiff.configure do |config|
  config.perceptual_diff_bin = `which perceptualdiff`.strip
  config.image_store_path = File.join('/home', 'user', 'images')
  config.xpath_elements_to_hide = ["id('main')"]
  config.failure_image_path = File.join('/home', 'user', 'failure_comparisions')
  config.max_wait_time = 2
end
```

### Spec usage

For a full page screenshot you can use the below;

```ruby
expect(page).to match_image('HomePage', subdir: 'Normitec')
```

For a specific element screenshot you can use like so;

```ruby
expect(find('#login-form')).to match_image('LoginForm', subdir: 'Normitec')
```

The only difference for the element specific is passing a specific element in the `expect` parameter.

| image_store_path       | The root path to store the base images                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | File.join('/home', 'user','images')                   | nil                            | Yes      |
| xpath_elements_to_hide | When taking full page screenshots it will hide elements specified that might change each time and re-shows them after the screenshot.  It doesn't use this option for taking screenshots of specific elements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | ["id('main')", "//div[contains(@class, 'formy'])[1]"] | []                             | No       |
| failure_image_path     | When a comparison occurs and the perceptual_diff binary returns a failure with the message. It will dump the new image taken for comparison to this directory.  If not supplied it will not move the images from the temporary location that it is generated at.                                                                                                                                                                                    | File.join('/home', 'user','failures')                 | nil                            | No       |
| max_wait_time          | This is similar to the Capybara#default_max_wait_time if you have a high value such as 10, as its possible that the  global xpath_elements_to_hide might not always exist it will wait the full time - therefore you can drop it for the hiding and showing of the elements.  In this example it would wait up 20 seconds in total 10 for hiding and 10 seconds for re-showing - that is if the element isn't even going to be present on the page. | 2                                                     | Capybara#default_max_wait_time | No       |

## Whats still to do

Its not fully completed yet but is usable in its current state.
 - Improve the message output to extract just the fail line
 - Add an integration spec
